# Team06 - Ambrosia

###Summary - Milestone 1:

Our work on this milestone aligned with our development plan. We have reviewed our plan for Milestone 2, and no changes are needed.

####AI
- Created the mob base class
- Made mob movement logic to move towards its closest player (linked with active turn component and pathfinding system)
\* Note: Egg is a mob

####Observer Pattern
- EventSystem which uses callbacks (event listeners) to be notified of events such as MouseClickEvent, HitEvent, projectile launch events, and so on. It is currently connected to the UISystem, TurnSystem, and ProjectileSystem.

###Geometric/sprite/other assets
- Created assets: background, navmesh, animated sprites, placeholder buttons
- Adjusted motion.scale's system to be a relative scale
- Implemented animation system and animations component
- Added render support for animated sprites using OpenGL 2D Array Textures
- Implemented geometric deformation (jiggling cheese blob)

####UI and IO
- Implemented clickable UI buttons (change character buttons, attack buttons)
- Implemented UI system to check if any buttons are clicked, and handles calling its callback function

####Collision
- Implemented AABB collision on entities
- Added scalable hitboxes for entities

####Pathfinding
- Implemented BFS pathfinding which is used for players (point-and-click movement) and AI.
- Modified the PhysicsSystem to allow an entity to move along a predefined path which was generated by the PathFindingSystem.

####Physics/projectiles
- Implemented the ProjectileSystem which allows for launching projectile attacks such as the bone throw attack. Projectiles can travel with a linear trajectory or a boomerang trajectory.
- Projectiles are entities and can collide with players and enemies. A HitEvent is sent (using the EventSystem) upon collision.

###Key Bindings for Debugging
- R = restart
- D = debug mode
- 3 = makes one of the player characters play his bone-throw attack animation (animation only)
- 4 = makes all the eggs play the hit animation
